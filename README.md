# Simple_Image_Classification_COMP1037

A Matlab project using Neural Network tool to train a NN to identify cats, dogs and pandas.

The main goal of this coursework is to introduce the process of machine learning and give 
you first-hand practice experience of using machine learning and data analysis tools provided by Matlab.

The folder ‘animals’ consists of 3000 images, of three classes: dogs, cats, and pandas with 1,000 images 
each. In this coursework, you will be using these 3,000 samples. Each image is stored with the class of 
animal followed by an index number in the format of ‘type_num.jpg’ (e.g., ‘cats_00123.jpg’).
